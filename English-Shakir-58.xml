		<Verse VerseID="90"><![CDATA[Evil is that for which they have sold their souls-- that they should deny what Allah has revealed, out of envy that Allah should send down of His grace on whomsoever of His servants He pleases; so they have made themselves deserving of wrath upon wrath, and there is a disgraceful punishment for the unbelievers.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="91"><![CDATA[And when it is said to them, Believe in what Allah has revealed, they say: We believe in that which was revealed to us; and they deny what is besides that, while it is the truth verifying that which they have.

		<Verse VerseID="93"><![CDATA[And when We made a covenant with you and raised the mountain over you: Take hold of what We have given you with firmness and be obedient.

		<Verse VerseID="96"><![CDATA[And you will most certainly find them the greediest of men for life (greedier) than even those who are polytheists; every one of them loves that he should be granted a life of a thousand years, and his being granted a long life will in no way remove him further off from the chastisement, and Allah sees what they do.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="97"><![CDATA[Say: Whoever is the enemy of Jibreel-- for surely he revealed it to your heart by Allah´s command, verifying that which is before it and guidance and good news for the believers.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="98"><![CDATA[Whoever is the enemy of Allah and His angels and His messengers and Jibreel and Meekaeel, so surely Allah is the enemy of the unbelievers.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="99"><![CDATA[And certainly We have revealed to you clear communications and none disbelieve in them except the transgressors.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="100"><![CDATA[What! whenever they make a covenant, a party of them cast it aside? Nay, most of them do not believe.]]></Verse>

		<Verse VerseID="102"><![CDATA[And they followed what the Shaitans chanted of sorcery in the reign of Sulaiman, and Sulaiman was not an unbeliever, but the Shaitans disbelieved, they taught men sorcery and that was sent down to the two angels at Babel, Harut and Marut, yet these two taught no man until they had said, "Surely we are only a trial, therefore do not be a disbeliever." Even then men learned from these two, magic by which they might cause a separation between a man and his wife; and they cannot hurt with it any one except with Allah´s permission, and they learned what harmed them and did not profit them, and certainly they know that he who bought it should have no share of good in the hereafter and evil was the price for which they sold their souls, had they but known this.]]></Verse>

		<Verse VerseID="104"><![CDATA[O you who believe! do not say Raina and say Unzurna and listen, and for the unbelievers there is a painful chastisement.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="105"><![CDATA[Those who disbelieve from among the followers of the Book do not like, nor do the polytheists, that the good should be sent down to you from your Lord, and Allah chooses especially whom He pleases for His mercy, and Allah is the Lord of mighty grace.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="106"><![CDATA[Whatever communications We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, We bring one better than it or like it. Do you not know that Allah has power over all things?]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="107"><![CDATA[Do you not know that Allah´s is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and that besides Allah you have no guardian or helper?]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="108"><![CDATA[Rather you wish to put questions to your Messenger, as Musa was questioned before; and whoever adopts unbelief instead of faith, he indeed has lost the right direction of the way.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="109"><![CDATA[Many of the followers of the Book wish that they could turn you back into unbelievers after your faith, out of envy from themselves, (even) after the truth has become manifest to them; but pardon and forgive, so that Allah should bring about His command; surely Allah has power over all things.]]></Verse>

		<Verse VerseID="113"><![CDATA[And the Jews say: The Christians do not follow anything (good) and the Christians say: The Jews do not follow anything (good) while they recite the (same) Book. Even thus say those who have no knowledge, like to what they say; so Allah shall judge between them on the day of resurrection in what they differ.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="114"><![CDATA[And who is more unjust than he who prevents (men) from the masjids of Allah, that His name should be remembered in them, and strives to ruin them?

		<Verse VerseID="118"><![CDATA[And those who have no knowledge say: Why does not Allah speak to us or a sign come to us? Even thus said those before them, the like of what they say; their hearts are all alike. Indeed We have made the communications clear for a people who are sure.]]></Verse>

		<Verse VerseID="57"><![CDATA[Said he: Have you come to us that you should turn us out of our land by your magic, O Musa?]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="58"><![CDATA[So we too will produce before you magic like it, therefore make between us and you an appointment, which we should not break, (neither) we nor you, (in) a central place.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="59"><![CDATA[(Musa) said: Your appointment is the day of the Festival and let the people be gathered together in the early forenoon.]]></Verse>

		<Verse VerseID="68"><![CDATA[We said: Fear not, surely you shall be the uppermost,]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="69"><![CDATA[And cast down what is in your right hand; it shall devour what they have wrought; they have wrought only the plan of a magician, and the magician shall not be successful wheresoever he may come from.]]></Verse>

		<Verse VerseID="71"><![CDATA[(Firon) said: You believe in him before I give you leave; most surely he is the chief of you who taught you enchantment, therefore I will certainly cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides, and I will certainly crucify you on the trunks of the palm trees, and certainly you will come to know which of us is the more severe and the more abiding in chastising.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="72"><![CDATA[They said: We do not prefer you to what has come to us of clear arguments and to He Who made us, therefore decide what you are going to decide; you can only decide about this world´s life.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="73"><![CDATA[Surely we believe in our Lord that He may forgive us our sins and the magic to which you compelled us; and Allah is better and more abiding.]]></Verse>

		<Verse VerseID="76"><![CDATA[The gardens of perpetuity, beneath which rivers flow, to abide therein; and this is the reward of him who has purified himself.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="77"><![CDATA[And certainly We revealed to Musa, saying: Travel by night with My servants, then make for them a dry path in the sea, not fearing to be overtaken, nor being afraid.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="78"><![CDATA[And Firon followed them with his armies, so there came upon them of the sea that which came upon them.]]></Verse>

		<Verse VerseID="80"><![CDATA[O children of Israel! indeed We delivered you from your enemy, and We made a covenant with you on the blessed side of the mountain, and We sent to you the manna and the quails.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="81"><![CDATA[Eat of the good things We have given you for sustenance, and be not inordinate with respect to them, lest My wrath should be due to you, and to whomsoever My wrath is due be shall perish indeed.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="82"><![CDATA[And most surely I am most Forgiving to him who repents and believes and does good, then continues to follow the right direction.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="83"><![CDATA[And what caused you to hasten from your people, O Musa?]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="84"><![CDATA[He said: They are here on my track and I hastened on to Thee, my Lord, that Thou mightest be pleased.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="85"><![CDATA[He said: So surely We have tried your people after you, and the Samiri has led them astray.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="86"><![CDATA[So Musa returned to his people wrathful, sorrowing.

		<Verse VerseID="87"><![CDATA[They said: We did not break (our) promise to you of our own accord, but we were made to bear the burdens of the ornaments of the people, then we made a casting of them, and thus did the Samiri suggest.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="88"><![CDATA[So he brought forth for them a calf, a (mere) body, which had a mooing sound, so they said: This is your god and the god of Musa, but he forgot.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="89"><![CDATA[What! could they not see that it did not return to them a reply, and (that) it did not control any harm or benefit for them?]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="90"><![CDATA[And certainly Haroun had said to them before: O my people! you are only tried by it, and surely your Lord is the Beneficent Allah, therefore follow me and obey my order.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="91"><![CDATA[They said: We will by no means cease to keep to its worship until Musa returns to us.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="92"><![CDATA[(Musa) said: O Haroun! what prevented you, when you saw them going astray,]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="93"><![CDATA[So that you did not follow me? Did you then disobey my order?]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="94"><![CDATA[He said: O son of my mother! seize me not by my beard nor by my head; surely I was afraid lest you should say: You have caused a division among the children of Israel and not waited for my word.]]></Verse>

		<Verse VerseID="1"><![CDATA[Ta sin Mim.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="2"><![CDATA[These are the verses of the Book that makes (things) clear.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="3"><![CDATA[We recite to you from the account of Musa and Firon with truth for people who believe.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="4"><![CDATA[Surely Firon exalted himself in the land and made its people into parties, weakening one party from among them; he slaughtered their sons and let their women live; surely he was one of the mischiefmakers.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="5"><![CDATA[And We desired to bestow a favor upon those who were deemed weak in the land, and to make them the Imams, and to make them the heirs,]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="6"><![CDATA[And to grant them power in the land, and to make Firon and Haman and their hosts see from them what they feared.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="7"><![CDATA[And We revealed to Musa´s mothers, saying: Give him suck, then when you fear for him, cast him into the river and do not fear nor grieve; surely We wi!l bring him back to you and make him one of the messengers.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="8"><![CDATA[And Firon´s family took him up that he might be an enemy and a grief for them; surely Firon and Haman and their hosts were wrongdoers.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="9"><![CDATA[And Firon´s wife said: A refreshment of the eye to me and to you; do not slay him; maybe he will be useful to us, or we may take him for a son; and they did not perceive.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="10"><![CDATA[And the heart of Musa´s mother was free (from anxiety) she would have almost disclosed it had We not strengthened her heart so that she might be of the believers.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="11"><![CDATA[And she said to his sister: Follow him up. So she watched him from a distance while they did not perceive,]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="12"><![CDATA[And We ordained that he refused to suck any foster mother before, so she said: Shall I point out to you the people of a house who will take care of him for you, and they will be benevolent to him?]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="13"><![CDATA[So We gave him back to his mother that her eye might be refreshed, and that she might no grieve, and that she might know that the promise of Allah is true, but most of them do not know.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="14"><![CDATA[And when he attained his maturity and became full grown, We granted him wisdom and knowledge; and thus do We reward those who do good (to others).]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="15"><![CDATA[And he went into the city at a time of unvigilance on the part of its people, so he found therein two men fighting, one being of his party and the other of his foes, and he who was of his party cried out to him for help against him who was of his enemies, so Musa struck him with his fist and killed him. He said: This is on account of the Shaitan´s doing; surely he is an enemy, openly leading astray.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="16"><![CDATA[He said: My Lord! surely I have done harm to myself, so do Thou protect me. So He protected him; surely He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="17"><![CDATA[He said: My Lord! because Thou hast bestowed a favor on me, I shall never be a backer of the guilty.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="18"><![CDATA[And he was in the city, fearing, awaiting, when lo! he who had asked his assistance the day before was crying out to him for aid. Musa said to him: You are most surely one erring manifestly.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="19"><![CDATA[So when he desired to seize him who was an enemy to them both, he said: O Musa! do you intend to kill me as you killed a person yesterday? You desire nothing but that you should be a tyrant in the land, and you do not desire to be of those who act aright.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="20"><![CDATA[And a man came running from the remotest part of the city. He said: O Musa! surely the chiefs are consulting together to slay you, therefore depart (at once); surely I am of those who wish well to you.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="21"><![CDATA[So he went forth therefrom, fearing, awaiting, (and) he said: My Lord! deliver me from the unjust people.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="22"><![CDATA[And when he turned his face towards Madyan, he said: Maybe my Lord will guide me in the right path.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="23"><![CDATA[And when he came to the water of Madyan, he found on it a group of men watering, and he found besides them two women keeping back (their flocks). He said: What is the matter with you? They said: We cannot water until the shepherds take away (their sheep) from the water, and our father is a very old man.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="24"><![CDATA[So he watered (their sheep) for them, then went back to the shade and said: My Lord! surely I stand in need of whatever good Thou mayest send down to me.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="25"><![CDATA[Then one of the two women came to him walking bashfully. She said: My father invites you that he may give you the reward of your having watered for us. So when he came to him and gave to him the account, he said: Fear not, you are secure from the unjust people.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="26"><![CDATA[Said one of them: O my father! employ him, surely the best of those that you can employ is the strong man, the faithful one.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="27"><![CDATA[He said: I desire to marry one of these two daughters of mine to you on condition that you should serve me for eight years; but if you complete ten, it will be of your own free will, and I do not wish to be hard to you; if Allah please, you will find me one of the good.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="28"><![CDATA[He said: This shall be (an agreement) between me and you; whichever of the two terms I fulfill, there shall be no wrongdoing to me; and Allah is a witness of what we say.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="29"><![CDATA[So when Musa had fulfilled the term, and he journeyed with his family, he perceived on this side of the mountain a fire. He said to his family: Wait, I have seen a fire, maybe I will bring to you from it some news or a brand of fire, so that you may warm yourselves.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="30"><![CDATA[And when he came to it, a voice was uttered from the right side of the valley in the blessed spot of the bush, saying: O Musa! surely I am Allah, the Lord of the worlds.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="31"><![CDATA[And saying: Cast down you staff. So when he saw it in motion as if it were a serpent, he turned back retreating, and did not return. O Musa! come forward and fear not; surely you are of those who are secure;]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="32"><![CDATA[Enter your hand into the opening of your bosom, it will come forth white without evil, and draw your hand to yourself to ward off fear: so these two shall be two arguments from your Lord to Firon and his chiefs, surely they are a transgressing people.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="33"><![CDATA[He said: My Lord! surely I killed one of them, so I fear lest they should slay me;]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="34"><![CDATA[And my brother, Haroun, he is more eloquent of tongue than I, therefore send him with me as an aider, verifying me: surely I fear that they would reject me.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="35"><![CDATA[He said: We will strengthen your arm with your brother, and We will give you both an authority, so that they shall not reach you; (go) with Our signs; you two and those who follow you shall be uppermost.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="36"><![CDATA[So when Musa came to them with Our clear signs, they said: This is nothing but forged enchantment, and we never heard of it amongst our fathers of old.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="37"><![CDATA[And Musa said: My Lord knows best who comes with guidance from Him, and whose shall be the good end of the abode; surely the unjust shall not be successful.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="38"><![CDATA[And Firon said: O chiefs! I do not know of any god for you besides myself; therefore kindle a fire for me, O Haman, for brick, then prepare for me a lofty building so that I may obtain knowledge of Musa´s god, and most surely I think him to be one of the liars.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="39"><![CDATA[And he was unjustly proud in the land, he and his hosts, and they deemed that they would not be brought back to Us.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="40"><![CDATA[So We caught hold of him and his hosts, then We cast them into the sea, and see how was the end of the unjust.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="41"><![CDATA[And We made them Imams who call to the fire, and on the day of resurrection they shall not be assisted.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="42"><![CDATA[And We caused a curse to follow them in this world, and on the day of resurrection they shall be of those made to appear hideous.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="43"><![CDATA[And certainly We gave Musa the Book after We had destroyed the former generations, clear arguments for men and a guidance and a mercy, that they may be mindful.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="44"><![CDATA[And you were not on the western side when We revealed to Musa the commandment, and you were not among the witnesses;]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="45"><![CDATA[But We raised up generations, then life became prolonged to them; and you were not dwelling among the people of Madyan, reciting to them Our communications, but We were the senders.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="46"><![CDATA[And you were not on this side of the mountain when We called, but a mercy from your Lord that you may warn a people to whom no warner came before you, that they may be mindful.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="47"><![CDATA[And were it not that there should befall them a disaster for what their hands have sent before, then they should say: Our Lord! why didst Thou not send to us a messenger so that we should have followed Thy communications and been of the believers!]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="48"><![CDATA[But (now) when the truth has come to them from Us, they say: Why is he not given the like of what was given to Musa? What! did they not disbelieve in what Musa was given before? They say: Two magicians backing up each other; and they say: Surely we are unbelievers in all.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="49"><![CDATA[Say: Then bring some (other) book from Allah which is a better guide than both of them, (that) I may follow it, if you are truthful.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="50"><![CDATA[But if they do not answer you, then know that they only follow their low desires; and who is more erring than he who follows his low desires without any guidance from Allah? Surely Allah does not guide the unjust people.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="51"><![CDATA[And certainly We have made the word to reach them so that they may be mindful.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="52"><![CDATA[(As to) those whom We gave the Book before it, they are believers in it.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="53"><![CDATA[And when it is recited to them they say: We believe in it surely it is the truth from our Lord; surely we were submitters before this.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="54"><![CDATA[These shall be granted their reward twice, because they are steadfast and they repel evil with good and spend out of what We have given them.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="55"><![CDATA[And when they hear idle talk they turn aside from it and say: We shall have our deeds and you shall have your deeds; peace be on you, we do not desire the ignorant.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="56"><![CDATA[Surely you cannot guide whom you love, but Allah guides whom He pleases, and He knows best the followers of the right way.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="57"><![CDATA[And they say: If we follow the guidance with you, we shall be carried off from our country. What! have We not settled them in a safe, sacred territory to which fruits of every kind shall be drawn?-- a sustenance from Us; but most of them do not know.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="58"><![CDATA[And how many a town have We destroyed which exulted in its means of subsistence, so these are their abodes, they have not been dwelt in after them except a little, and We are the inheritors,]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="59"><![CDATA[And your Lord never destroyed the towns until He raised in their metropolis a messenger, reciting to them Our communications, and We never destroyed the towns except when their people were unjust.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="60"><![CDATA[And whatever things you have been given are only a provision of this world´s life and its adornment, and whatever is with Allah is better and more lasting; do you not then understand?]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="61"><![CDATA[Is he to whom We have promised a goodly promise which he shall meet with like him whom We have provided with the provisions of this world´s life, then on the day of resurrection he shall be of those who are brought up?]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="62"><![CDATA[And on the day when He will call them and say: Where are those whom you deemed to be My associates?]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="63"><![CDATA[Those against whom the sentence has become confirmed will say: Our Lord! these are they whom we caused to err; we caused them to err as we ourselves did err; to Thee we declare ourselves to be clear (of them); they never served Us.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="64"><![CDATA[And it will be said: Call your associate-gods. So they will call upon them, but they will not answer them, and they shall see the punishment; would that they had followed the right way!]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="65"><![CDATA[And on the day when He shall call them and say: What was the answer you gave to the messengers?]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="66"><![CDATA[Then the pleas shall become obscure to them on that day, so they shall not ask each other.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="67"><![CDATA[But as to him who repents and believes and does good, maybe he will be among the successful:]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="68"><![CDATA[And your Lord creates and chooses whom He pleases; to choose is not theirs; glory be to Allah, and exalted be He above what they associate (with Him).]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="69"><![CDATA[And your Lord knows what their breasts conceal and what they manifest.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="70"><![CDATA[And He is Allah, there is no god but He! All praise is due to Him in this (life) and the hereafter, and His is the judgment, and to Him you shall be brought back.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="71"><![CDATA[Say: Tell me, if Allah were to make the night to continue incessantly on you till the day of resurrection, who is the god besides Allah that could bring you light? Do you not then hear?]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="72"><![CDATA[Say: Tell me, if Allah were to make the day to continue incessantly on you till the day of resurrection, who is the god besides Allah that could bring you the night in which you take rest? Do you not then see?]]></Verse>

		<Verse VerseID="74"><![CDATA[And on the day when He shall call them and say: Where are those whom you deemed to be My associates?]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="75"><![CDATA[And We will draw forth from among every nation a witness and say: Bring your proof; then shall they know that the truth is Allah´s, and that which they forged shall depart from them.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="76"><![CDATA[Surely Qaroun was of the people of Musa, but he rebelled against them, and We had given him of the treasures, so much so that his hoards of wealth would certainly weigh down a company of men possessed of great strength. When his people said to him: Do not exult, surely Allah does not love the exultant;]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="77"><![CDATA[And seek by means of what Allah has given you the future abode, and do not neglect your portion of this world, and do good (to others) as Allah has done good to you, and do not seek to make mischief in the land, surely Allah does not love the mischief-makers.]]></Verse>
		<Verse VerseID="78"><![CDATA[He said: I have been given this only on account of the knowledge I have.
